# G2CC (G2 Control Center) — Handoff for fresh Claude Code sessions

**Last updated: 2026-06-04, after probe v12 achieved a PERSISTENT, PHONE-INITIATED Hub-app session on Adam's hardware (the core architectural goal is proven), followed by a full-project code-review remediation (`v0.0.1-4ec8384`: 2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 11 LOW — see CHANGELOG.md). Read this first, then the "Required reading" files, then proceed.**

---

## TL;DR — where we are

**The breakthrough is done.** Adam's goal: open an Android app, and it controls the G2 glasses all day with **zero use of the glasses' built-in menu**, self-healing on drops (see memory `g2cc-app-initiated-goal`). As of probe v12 (`v0.0.1-32c7302`) we have, validated on his hardware:

1. **Phone-initiated COLD LAUNCH** — the phone drives a Hub app onto the glasses with no glasses-menu selection. We render OUR menu under DocuLens's slot.
2. **Input** — the ring forwards events to us (`e0-01 f1=2`) and navigates our own menu.
3. **Persistent session** — it **stays alive indefinitely**, input or not, via the keepalive we finally found: the `e0-20` **`f1=12`** app-state message every ~4s.

This took 12 probe versions (v3→v12) and an 8-version keepalive hunt. The hard-won keepalive facts are below and in memory `keepalive-is-content-rerender`.

## The working recipe (probe v12 — this is the answer)

All frames ride GATT char `0x5401`; the `e0-XX` service id lives in the AA-frame header (it is NOT a separate GATT characteristic). Sequence:

1. **Connect + 7-packet auth** to L+R lenses (existing `AuthSequence`).
2. **Display init** to R (verbatim from capture, `ReplayKit.COLD_INIT`): `81-20` Display Trigger, `04-20` Display Wake, `0e-20` region config.
3. **Cold launch**: send `e0-20` launch-response `f1=0` (DocuLens token **11417**, `ReplayKit.DOCULENS_LAUNCH`) → glasses ack on `e0-00` → send our menu `e0-20 f1=7` (`ReplayKit.G2CC_MENU`).
4. **Keepalive**: send `e0-20` **`f1=12`** (`08 0c 10 <msgId> 72 00`, `ReplayKit.stateAlive12`) to R **every ~4s, forever**. THIS is what keeps the session alive. Plus an `80-00` sync_trigger to L+R (connection-level, harmless).
5. **Inputs** arrive on `e0-01 f1=2`; the firmware navigates our menu locally and reports focus.

**Do NOT send `e0-20 f1=9`** (`08 09 10 <id> 5a 02 08 01`) — it ALSO keeps the session alive but triggers the native "End This Feature?" exit menu on its own cadence. f1=12 is the clean keepalive; f1=9 is the exit-menu trigger.

## ⚠️ Known issue — the next thing to fix

**The display blanks when the on-screen content doesn't CHANGE for too long** (Adam, 2026-06-04 — it's a *display-refresh* timeout, NOT an input timeout and NOT a disconnect). The `f1=12` keepalive keeps the **session** alive, but does NOT keep the **display** lit if the visible content is static too long. The screen just goes dark; no "Connection Lost". Official Even Hub apps do this too. **It matters for voice-only control (DJI Mic):** during a spoken command the HUD content may not change for a stretch, so it would blank. Fix is likely a periodic real *content update* (re-send the menu/content with an actual visible change) layered on top of the f1=12 keepalive. **Confirming data point (Adam): autoscroll while reading a book does NOT blank** — because the content is continuously changing. So the fix is to keep the visible content changing, not just keep the session alive. Mine a sustained-idle Even App capture for how it refreshes the display.

## What works today (verified on hardware)

- ✅ BLE pair + 7-packet auth to L+R
- ✅ Phone-initiated cold launch (no glasses menu) — menu renders
- ✅ Ring input forwarded to us, navigates our menu
- ✅ **Persistent session via `f1=12` keepalive (probe v12) — alive 56s+ with zero interaction, indefinitely with the 4s beat**
- ✅ Wake lock held while connected (heartbeat fires screen-off)
- ✅ DJI Mic 3 USB-C capture (stereo float32 48k) + server noise pipeline + Parakeet (all pre-existing, stable)
- ✅ WebSocket auth + Claude Code subprocess dispatch (pre-existing)

## Code-review remediation (`v0.0.1-4ec8384`, 2026-06-04)

A full-tree review (Android + server + audio + shared) landed 15 verified fixes on
top of probe v12. **Nothing on the proven probe path changed** — single-packet
notify frames pass through byte-for-byte and the teleprompter render is identical,
so this build doubles as a regression check of the working flow. Headlines: the
WebSocket "stuck" last-resort recovery (defence #5) was a log-only stub *and*
measured the wrong clock — now a real `G2Pipeline.restartConnectionStack()` keyed
off `offlineSince`; added multi-packet notify reassembly (`FrameReassembler`, a
latent silent-loss hole); plus a batch of latent-correctness/honesty fixes. One
agent-reported finding was **rejected on verification** as a false positive (the
"overlapping audio_start discarded N bytes" log is always truthful — unreachable
"both true" branch in single-threaded Node). Full WHY in CHANGELOG.md. Test count
is now 134 (all green).

**Three fixes are logic-sound + compile-clean but NOT yet hardware/live-validated**
— check these on the next real-device pass:
1. **Defence-#5 stuck-recovery rebuild** (`G2Pipeline.restartConnectionStack`) —
   force a >90 s offline stretch; confirm it tears down + rebuilds + reconnects.
2. **Crash-loop → phone** — a CC subprocess that crash-loops should now surface a
   `cc_error` on the HUD (was server-log-only before).
3. **`interrupt` clears "processing"** — the HUD shouldn't wedge on "processing"
   after an interrupt that yields no CC `result`.

## Dead paths / facts — don't re-investigate

- **Teleprompter (`0x06-20`) eats inputs** — it's a native firmware feature; inputs never reach the phone. The Hub-app (`e0-XX`) path is what gives display + input.
- **Hijacking DocuLens works** for our purposes (cold launch its token, drive our content). We did NOT need a custom Hub app to get here. (A custom "G2CC Mode" app via the Hub SDK is still an option for a cleaner identity, but not required.)
- **Keepalive dead-ends (all tried, all failed for EvenHub):** `80-00` sync_trigger alone, content (`f1=7`) re-render, responding to inputs, full re-launch, sync_trigger-to-both-lenses. The ONLY thing that works is `f1=12`.
- **Refuted by capture (Even App does NOT do these):** respond to `80-01` pings, send Commit (`20-20`), periodic display-wake, R1-ring registration (ring is optional — glasses work identically without it).
- **The session death was the glasses reverting to native UI** (`01-01` magic-`0x12345678` burst), not a BLE drop. BLE/`e0` channel stays alive through it.

## Key files

- **Probe (the live work):** `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/g2cc/g2cc/probe/`
  - `ProbeActivity.kt` — UI, cold launch, keepalive heartbeat (`startStateAlive`/`sendStateAlive` = f1=12), sync_trigger heartbeat, diag streaming
  - `ReplayKit.kt` — all the EvenHub frames + builders (`DOCULENS_LAUNCH`, `G2CC_MENU`, `COLD_INIT`, `stateAlive9`/`stateAlive12`), each CRC-verified in `ReplayKitTest`
  - `BleProbeClient.kt` — permissive BLE client (subscribes to every notify char, `sendToChar` to any char)
  - `ProbeSend.kt` — manual send-prep (RAW/FRAME), tested
- **Shared BLE (verified correct in review):** `ble/G2Frame.kt`, `Crc16.kt`, `Varint.kt`, `AuthSequence.kt`, `Teleprompter.kt` (`buildSyncTrigger`), `G2Constants.kt`
- **Analysis tools:** `scripts/btsnoop_parse.py` (BTSnoop→HCI→ATT→AA-frame parser, bug-fixed; takes a btsnoop path as argv). `/tmp/build_kit.py` was the frame builder (one-shot; templates captured containers).
- **Protocol reference:** `docs/PROTOCOL_NOTES.md` (+ the EvenHub section). `docs/EVENHUB_FINDING.md` (the original channel discovery).
- **Captures:** the BTSnoops came from Android bug reports Adam emails to `adam@marzello.net`; pull via `mbsync -a` then parse from `~/Mail/marzello.net/INBOX`. Raw captures lived in `/tmp/g2cc-btsnoop*/`.

## Build + release flow

- Build: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/openjdk-bin-17 ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk /home/user/G2CC/android/gradlew -p /home/user/G2CC/android testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug` (cwd resets to repo root between Bash calls — use `-p`).
- APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. 134 unit tests (BLE + hud + probe + audio-prep), keep green. Latest release: `v0.0.1-4ec8384`.
- Release: `gh release create "v0.0.1-<shortsha>" "<apk>#g2cc-probe-vN.apk" --target <fullsha> --title ... --notes ...` (gh authed as `amarzello`, remote `expectbugs/G2CC`). Adam installs via phone browser → release URL. **Put the APK link LAST in your reply** (memory `terminal-scroll-links-last`).
- Server: Node on `:7300`, tails probe diag into `/tmp/g2cc-server.log`. The probe streams every event there — READ IT to diagnose (don't theorize).

## How Adam works / critical rules

- Adam SSHes from his phone at a factory; he runs every hardware test, you never touch the phone. He's sharp, calls out lazy reasoning, wants data not guesses.
- **Mr. Awesome canary** (global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): if you stop calling him Mr. Awesome in a long session, context is truncating — tell him.
- **Ten Explanations rule** (NEW, global CLAUDE.md + memory `ten-explanations-rule`): on ANY hiccup, generate ≥10 distinct explanations fitting ALL data before narrowing. I violated this repeatedly this session — don't.
- **Three absolute rules:** no timeouts (HB/AUTH annotated exceptions OK), no silent failures (surface BLE write fails to the diag log, not just logcat), no truncation.
- **Don't guess the wire format** — read the captures / `PROTOCOL_NOTES`. Don't touch `/home/user/g2code/` or `/home/user/g2aria/`. Gentoo+OpenRC+Portage, SSH on 80, venv-only Python.

## Recommended next steps

1. **Fix the display-blank-on-idle** (the known issue above) — critical for voice-only control. Capture an idle Even App session to find the missing signal.
2. **Port the proven recipe into the production app's hardened service** (`G2Pipeline`/`G2CCService` already have foreground-service + wake-lock + reconnect). The probe proved the protocol; production integration is the path to all-day use.
3. **Wire the existing menu/STT/Claude-Code flow** (RootMenu, SttConfirmationFlow, the CC dispatcher) onto the EvenHub display+input instead of teleprompter.
4. **DJI noise profile capture** at the machine (still pending — using a phone-recording prototype profile; `machine.npz` is a phone `.m4a` artifact with peaks inside the speech band, must be re-recorded with the DJI TX2).
5. **On the next hardware pass, spot-check the 3 unvalidated remediation fixes** (see "Code-review remediation" above) — they compile + pass review but haven't touched real glasses / a live server.

Welcome aboard. The session-persistence wall that blocked everything is down, and the tree is now code-review-hardened (`v0.0.1-4ec8384`). The remaining work is the idle-blank fix and wiring the proven primitive into the real app.
