# G2 Desktop Environment — design contract (FINALIZED 2026-06-10)

Decisions locked with Adam this session (mockups: `sdk-demo/src/mockup.ts`, screens
`?screen=cc|aria|main|mail`, sim-rendered per `docs/SIM_TOOLING.md`). This is the contract the
implementation builds against. Wire truth: `docs/G2_BLE_PROTOCOL.md`. OS architecture:
`docs/GLASSES_OS.md` (this doc refines its Phase-2+ design; where they differ, THIS wins).

If "12:59 PM" clips at 102px, widen `CLOCK_WIDTH` — a single tunable from the
2026-06-10 eyeball cal.
The clock and the tab strip get their ~5px inset from a LEADING SPACE + extra width,
NOT padding — hardware 2026-06-10: padding 4 inside a 33px bar dropped the vertical
room below the firmware's threshold and triggered the overflow scrollbar.

No region overlaps anything (SceneCodec loud-fails on clock-cutout overlap — and on a
server/client GEOMETRY-SKEW: a new-geometry server vs an old APK rejects every scene with
"overlaps the clock cutout"; rebuild + reinstall the APK when CLOCK_* changes). Region budget
in the worst (tile) mode: clock + title + menu + status + tabs + 4 tiles = **9 ≤ 12**
containers, **4 ≤ 8** text, **4 ≤ 4** image, exactly **one** event-capture. ✓

**Stable region ids** (server-assigned, identical across windows so switches diff small):
clock=1 (client), title=2, menu=3 (ALWAYS a list), status=4, tabs=5, browse list=6,
content text=7, tiles=10..13 (`t0..t3`), content right-column=14 (`content2`, the
twocol mode — Adam 2026-06-12, Main's one-page dashboard).

## 2. Interaction model

- **Exactly one event-capture region** per screen (wire: text `f11` / list `f12`):
  - **Reading windows (tiles/text content): the MENU list** holds focus. Scroll moves the
    firmware selection, tap selects. Items are the window's **current action set** — they
    change with state (CC idle: `Dictate/Next/Prev/Options/Reload/Main`; permission-pending:
    `Next/Prev/Approve/Deny/Reload/Main` — Approve/Deny deliberately NOT at index 0/1, so a
    tap racing a busy→permission rebuild lands on Next/Prev, never an unread Approve). Tap
    does NOT rebuild the menu → selection stays put → tap-tap-tap through pages on `Next`.
  - **Browse windows (CC picker, Mail list, Files tree): the CONTENT list** holds focus by
    default; the left menu is a REAL list of the window's actions (`Reload / Main`, …).
    **Double-tap flips focus content → menu** (menu list captures, ring moves there; menu
    actions hand focus back to the rows); double-tap again pops out (→ Main). >~14 rows page
    via `— prev — / — more —` rows.
  - **Files' locations level is a plain browse list** (REVERTED from the per-notch antenna
    live-preview 2026-06-11 — Adam: "feels janky"): a normal content list of locations, tap
    to enter the tree. The scroll=true antenna PATTERN itself remains hardware-proven and
    load-bearing in `blankScene()`'s wake region (and the legacy probe/menu screens) — only
    the locations preview use died.
- **Reload everywhere** (Adam 2026-06-10, mechanism revised in v1.3): every reading menu has
  `Reload`; browse windows reach it via the DOUBLE-TAP focus flip to the left menu list (the
  once-planned compose-injected row-0 was superseded). Reload = `display_reload` to the client
  (abort any wedged render op + COLD_INIT re-takeover with the current scene — the proven
  renewal path) + the active window clears stuck transients (mic, errors) + recompose.
- **Main** = menu list of windows (capture on the menu) + the live DASHBOARD in the content
  pane (Phase 5, 2026-06-11 — replaced the logo tile): host + pool + unseen count, then one
  `Label: summary()` line per window, 30 s re-render pacing while Main is active. Content
  paginates (menu gains Next/Prev) if the window count outgrows a page.
- **Taps resolve against the last-RENDERED view** (WM `lastView`), and the WM-level labels
  (`Retry/Reload/Back/Main`) work in every window and state — incl. error screens.
- **Double-tap = back (pop one level)** — reading → list → menu focus → window root → Main;
  at MAIN's root → **blank the screen**; double-tap again wakes. The blank scene = the
  client clock + a whitespace `wake` ANTENNA region — HARDWARE RULE (2026-06-06, re-bitten
  2026-06-10): a scroll=true clock as the SOLE text region kills ALL input incl. double-tap;
  the v1.2 blank screen did exactly that (wake took many taps). `Main` stays a menu item
  everywhere.
- **Renders are preemptable** (Adam 2026-06-10): a newer scene (a menu tap's response) does
  NOT wait behind an in-flight 4-tile push. The client preempts at the next REGION boundary —
  the current tile's chunk chain finishes (an interrupted mid-image transfer is unprobed
  firmware territory), remaining regions are skipped + rolled back so the next diff re-sends
  them. Worst-case tap latency ≈ one tile (~1 s) instead of a full page (~4 s). Cheap chrome
  text ops are also emitted BEFORE image ops within a render.
- **Dictation = the prompt input** (v1): menu `Dictate`/`Ask` → server sends `audio_request
  start` → phone streams mic (existing AudioStreamer/STT path). The transcript then enters a
  **CONFIRM step** (the g2aria CONFIRM_STT flow, ported 2026-06-11): the page shows "You
  said: …" and the menu offers `Confirm / Re-record / Cancel` — nothing reaches CC unread
  (Parakeet mangles words). NOT labeled 'Retry': that's a WM-level label (error screens)
  and the WM would eat the tap (window menu labels must avoid Retry/Reload/Back/Main). Menu swaps to `Done/Cancel` while listening. **Leaving the
  window (switch/pop/reload) stops the mic and discards unconfirmed transcripts** —
  phone-side capture failures come back as `[audio-error]` diags so the server never waits.
- **Live status bar** (g2aria-style, 2026-06-11): the bottom-left status slot shows the
  active session's phase as it moves — `listening… → transcribing… → confirm? → thinking…
  → tool X → writing…` (one ~62 ms text write per phase change; `+queued` when a prompt
  waits). Idle shows `● host · N cc`. **Battery cluster leads the slot, ALWAYS** (Adam
  2026-06-12): `G<g2> R<r1> P<phone> H<hat>` — `--` for not-yet-reported; R1 + hat are
  placeholders until their signals exist; G2 is [U] (client 09-00/09-01 decode).
  RIGHT-ALIGNED at the bar's end (Adam's correction, same day) via measured
  space padding; the phase/host text keeps the left.
- **Title flash APPENDS** (Adam 2026-06-12): an unseen info/sms/email notification renders
  as `<window title> · ⚠ <notification title>` (it used to replace the title); the px
  middle-clamp keeps the title head + flash tail visible.

## 3. Content modes (per window state — "browsing → firmware text/list; reading → image tiles")

- **tiles — NIXED for session content (Adam 2026-06-11).** On hardware, every menu state
  change rebuilt the layout and conservatively re-pushed all four tiles → taps took 15-20 s
  with zero feedback. CC/Aria responses are now **firmware text** (blocks flattened by
  `blocksToText`: headings + `─` dividers, `•` bullets, indented code, value/label lines),
  paginated server-side — every interaction is a ~62-86 ms text/list write. The 4-tile
  machinery (and the preemption/wall fences) remains for Main's single logo tile and any
  future static imagery; revisit rich tiles only after the hat's pacing sweep + the
  rebuild-retention probe make them cheap.
- **browse**: native firmware list in the content pane. Instant.
- **text**: firmware text region in the content pane (mail bodies, file previews — plain
  content where instant paging beats typography). Server pre-paginates (~9.0 px/char avg,
  34 px rows — measured `docs/SIM_TOOLING.md`); region scroll stays false.

## 4. Window set (v1 decided + v2 additions)

The first ten rows are the v1 set; the last five (`search`/`term`/`deliveries`/`media`/`sms`)
were added by the upgrades.md v2 queue (r19/r22) — **FIFTEEN windows total**.

| id | tab | modes | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | Main | twocol/text/tiles | menu = `Stats` + window list + Ask + Reload (tap switches); content = ONE page, TWO columns of very short per-window summaries (timer/unseen lines lead; host/pool/battery live in the status bar). `Stats` opens the deep-stats level: overview, CPU/temps/GPU/RAM charts (1 h ring, page-≥2-class imagery), storage volumes, top processes by CPU/MEM — Next/Prev pages, Back to the dashboard. Double-tap target at every root. (Adam 2026-06-12.) |
| `cc` | CC | browse→text | root = directory picker (browse /home/user/*); then the CC session: response→firmware-text pages, dynamic action menu, permission flow via menu. |
| `aria` | Aria | text | CC subprocess, cwd `/home/user/aria`, `--append-system-prompt` = `server/prompts/aria-g2.md` (teaches the ~44×6 text surface). |
| `scout` | Scout | text/browse/tiles | **(2026-07-09, `docs/SCOUT.md` = the contract)** the mixed-mode assistant: CC subprocess @ `/home/user/scout` (`scout-g2.md` prompt) whose answers embed ` ```g2img ` image pages (media-generalized PAGE-2 machinery) + push mid-turn live frames via `scout_show.py` → `/scout/live` (loopback+Bearer; ≤560 B AND ≤6 wrapped rows, turnSeq-stamped, truthful `displayed`). fullBleed answers = Reader-style scroll-read (menu-less; image pages fall back to menued tiles for Next/Prev); menued-first on fresh entry, ribbon reentry restores the menu + `Read`/`Type` verbs. Input = Ask dictation (sacred confirm) + `config.scout.quickPrompts` + the shared `_kbd.ts` tap keyboard (buffer survives parks, tail shown when long). **On-glass round 1 (2026-07-09):** double-tap in scroll-read surfaces Scout's OWN menu (`onScrollReadBack`, Ask at cell 0); dictation/suggest over an image page renders a TEXT card (tiles state-flips re-pushed ~150 BLE pkts → minutes-long freezes); busy/live menus lead Next/Prev with Interrupt demoted; the WM resets the fb cursor to cell 0 per menu change (stray-tap safety — a stray tap had aborted a $5 turn). Category Tools (the 2026-06-13 five-category rule). Web tooling: `fetch_images.py` list/get/shot + `fetch_page.py` + WebSearch. |
| `mail` | Mail | browse→text | Maildir `~/Mail/marzello.net/` (mbsync cron, every 5 min). List = INBOX newest-first; read = text/plain body, text mode + page-≥2 image pages; full program: **Reply / Reply all / Forward / Compose / Del→Trash / Unread** (Ph8; Reply-all added r25 — To=sender, Cc=others−me). `read_maildir.py` (read/search/senders/del/mark) + `send_mail.py` (msmtp). |
| `files` | Files | browse→text/tiles | **Real file manager (Adam 2026-06-12, expanded 2026-06-13):** locations → tree (`..` ALWAYS row 0 — at a location root it pops to locations). **Byte-aware pagination** — page size adapts to row length so a deep cwd (long title) + long filenames never trip the 960 B multi-packet wall (the old FIXED 14-row page did → the "≈970 B" non-listing bug). Tapping a FILE opens the ACTIONS level — Open / Move / Copy / **Rename** / Del / Stats; dirs descend on tap. **Directories are first-class:** descended below a location root, the tree menu is `Up/New/Copy/Move/Rename/Del/Stats` acting on the CURRENT dir (recursive `fs.cp`/`fs.rm`; copy-into-self/descendant guarded; a current-dir move/del follows/pops the stack). **Rename + New folder** take a name via a dictation→confirm 'name' level (sacred confirm; mic stops on every exit). Move/Copy run a destination picker (locations → dirs-only browse; **double-tap flips focus to the menu so "<verb> here"/Cancel are reachable — incl. depositing into a location ROOT**; tapping a folder prompts Open vs "<verb> here"). No overwrites — collisions loud-fail; cross-FS falls back to copy+remove (EXDEV). **Del → Trash** (`~/.g2cc-trash/<ms>-<name>`, restorable 30 days via the Trash location + Move; daily purge sweep), Cancel-FIRST confirm. Reload refreshes IN PLACE at every level. |
| `reader` | Reader | browse→browse→text | EPUB library (`~/books`) → chapters → paginated text (upgrades Ph7). **Browsable by SUBFOLDER** (r26): the library lists `..` + folders (`name/`) + books, arbitrary nesting via a `cwd` (modeled on Files; resolve-guarded to ~/books); a root **`Last`** menu item resumes the most-recently-read book (`getLastPosition`). **Resume position is the feature**: every page/chapter change persists (`reader_positions`, keyed by full path — so subfolder books resume independently); re-opening a book drops straight back into the page; Next/Prev roll across chapter boundaries. Parsing via `read_epub.py` subprocess. `BOOKS_DIR` = `G2CC_BOOKS_DIR` override for the smoke sandbox. **LOSS-PROOFED + Jump (r27, 2026-06-25):** a chapter pick no longer instantly persists page 0 (the old one-tap place-killer) — it stages a **Cancel-first Confirm** (`Cancel` at index 0 so a double-fire cancels); the saved position is untouched until Confirm. Every non-sequential move (chapter / numpad jump / bookmark / recent) **pushes the FROM spot to `reader_history`** (bounded 25-deep undo stack), so the read menu's **`↩ p.N` Undo** reverses any of them in one tap. **`Jump`** = an ABSOLUTE whole-book page numpad: `read_epub.py pages` (one parse → all chapter texts) → server `paginateText` per chapter → a cached page-count vector (`reader_pagemaps`, `size:mtime`-fingerprinted) → title shows `p.G/T · %`; out-of-range is rejected LOUD (no clamp). **`Mark`/`Bookmarks`** (named anchors, reading order, gate+`Delete`) + **`Recent`** (the undo trail, browsable). A failed save shows `⚠ unsaved` in the status line. Read menu: `Next/Prev/Jump/Mark/Bookmarks/Recent/[↩ p.N]/Voice/Back/Reload/Main` (613 B ≤ wall). |
| `timers` | Timers | browse→text | pending timers (tap → detail → `Cancel timer`) + `New 5/10/20/30/60 min` rows (Ph6). DB-backed (`timers`), re-armed at boot (missed fires fire late, marked); fires arrive as 'timer'-priority notifications. Voice creation via the Aria Ask intent pre-parse. |
| `calendar` | Calendr (menu) | browse→text | 14-day day-grouped agenda → event read view (Ph10, READ-ONLY). Synced from Google every 15 min via aria's OAuth (`read_gcal.py`); 10-min-lead reminders for timed events ride the notification layer. |
| `games` | Games | browse→text/tiles | rpg-cli (filesystem dungeon rooted at /home/user; action rows + dir descent; output paginated) and chess vs Stockfish (Ph11): board = IMAGE page (render_board.py → tiles, placeholder-swapped). **Moves flow (Adam 2026-06-12, revised 2026-06-13 — the tile-redraw fix): the board shows ONLY on the `chess` level (live position) + `chess-confirm` (preview); piece/move SELECTION renders TEXT (no tiles) because every menu change forced an f1=7 that re-pushed all 4 tiles. The MENU carries piece groups (`Pawn (12)`, `Knight (4)`, …) → that group's SAN moves (≤12 + » prev/» more) → tap a move → PREVIEW board + Confirm/Cancel; only Confirm commits. Double-tap = Cancel. `Skill` is a CONSTANT menu label (value in the title) so cycling it doesn't re-push the board.** Skill 1/5/10/20. Lichess deferred (gate A3.2). **Universal Paperclips (2026-06-27):** the REAL game runs headlessly in jsdom (`paperclips.ts`, a process-lifetime singleton that ticks in real time — an idle game; persists the whole `localStorage` save to `paperclips_save`, resumes on boot, flushes on shutdown). The window is a **phase-aware twocol DASHBOARD** (biz / space / end — `humanFlag=0` counts as space so the Earth-disassembly factory phase isn't soft-locked) + a short CONSTANT-label hot-verb menu + drill-downs: Projects browse→Cancel-first paginated confirm, Build (×1/10/100/1k drones), Probe (8-trust sliders), Swarm (+Work/Think slider), Strat/Invest(+Risk)/Quant. **Bulk-clip ×1000** (wire-clamped) and an **auto-quantum** toggle (auto-fire qComp when the chip sum is +) replace the twitch mechanics. Engine = `paperclips.ts`; smoke = `phase-paperclips.mjs`. |
| `notices` | Notices | browse→text | the persisted notification history, newest-first → read view (Ph4). Reading marks SEEN (clears the `!` title flash + badge; the `!` replaced ⚠ which the firmware doesn't render — r21). **MkAll** marks all + phone-dismisses; a `hasReply` post offers **Reply** (dictate → fills the RemoteInput, Ph4a). |
| `search` | Search | browse→text | **(v2 Ph12)** dictate a query → ONE results list across mail/files/history/notes (`search.ts`, per-source isolated); a mail/file hit HANDS OFF to its window (SwitchTo + onOpen), a history/note hit opens INLINE here. |
| `term` | Term | browse→text/tiles | **(v2 Ph5)** a viewer/controller of Adam's REAL tmux via DISCRETE commands (`tmux.ts`): session menu → **tail** (firmware text, lines WRAP at the pane width, ~500 ms poll) / **grid** (80×22 PIL→tiles, page-2) / **Focus** scrollback / quick-keys + dictation. **tail + Focus FIT one page** (`TERM_PAGE_ROWS`=6, tunable — the old 13 overflowed into an un-scrollable firmware scrollbar since the MENU, not the content, captures; r24); **Focus** pre-splits the frozen 1000-line snapshot into whole pages and steps Up/Down/Live (`scroll N/M`). A **full-width `─` rule bar collapses to `TERM_RULE_COLS`=18** (`collapseRules`); box-drawing-dense lines wrap with a **box-aware width** (`termTextWidth` via `wrapLinesPx`'s `widthFn`) because the firmware renders box-drawing `─` ~21 px, not the 9.6 px `fwTextWidth` assumes — the mismatch silently firmware-re-wrapped lines and slivered the scrollbar (cal: docs/SIM_TOOLING.md). Grid shows the true 80 cols untouched. Targets `=<session>:` (exact session, never a same-named window — r23). **Input (r25):** Keys is an input HUB — `⌨ Keyboard` (the specced Phase-5 fallback: char group→char→a buffer in the title→Run) + `/ Slash cmd` (one-tap `/clear` etc.) + the quick-keys; dictation, keyboard, and slash all send-AND-RUN (literal + Enter) on confirm. |
| `deliveries` | Deliv | browse→text | **(v2 Ph13)** carrier mail → tracked shipments (Info category), newest-first; the parser keeps real shipments + drops marketing (`(unparsed)` loud); 15-min Gmail sync via aria's token. **Out-for-delivery flash** (r25): an `info` notification fires ONCE per shipment when it goes out for delivery (`out_notified` latch; the migration backfills so no burst on deploy). |
| `media` | Media | text/tiles | **(v2 Ph7)** the phone's MediaSessionManager (via the existing NLS grant — no new permission): track/artist/album + a text position bar, **Play/Pause-on-top** (safety), Skip/Prev/Random, album art (page-2 tile), and an LRCLIB **Lyrics** level (synced LRC = karaoke current-line). Transport via `media_cmd`; state pushed via `media_state` while subscribed. **Random** = a real shuffle toggle via the player's PlaybackState CUSTOM ACTION (r25 — the framework session API has no shuffle setter; loud no-op if the player doesn't expose one). |
| `sms` | SMS | browse→text/tiles | **(v2 Ph4b)** the phone is the data provider (`Telephony.Sms` queried over the WS): threads → thread (paginated, newest block first; MMS image parts = page-2 tiles) → **Reply** (dictate → confirm → the live conversation notification's RemoteInput when one matches [keeps RCS on RCS, r25], else `SmsManager`). Voice "read <name>'s last text" opens the matched thread (r25). Needs READ_SMS/READ_CONTACTS/SEND_SMS. SMS-only (MMS-read + New-to-a-fresh-contact are follow-ups). |

Notification surfacing (Ph4, WM-owned): info/sms/email = ⚠ title-bar override (until read
in Notices) + unseen badge in the status slot; timer/call = full-page overlay
(`Open/Dismiss/Main`) that queues behind dictation/permission states; while BLANKED, every
priority pops for 10 s then auto-re-blanks (Adam 2026-06-11; marked seen at display).
Main's menu also carries `Ask` → switches to Aria and starts its dictation verb (Ph6).

Deferred: SMS inline-reply (Ph9 is read-only mirroring), Settings.

## 5. Wire/protocol additions (shared/src/protocol.ts ↔ WsProtocol.kt)

- `SceneRegionKind` += `'list'`; `SceneListContent { items, itemWidth?, selectBorder?,
  eventCapture? }`. List items ride the LAYOUT frame (no f1=5-style update exists for lists) —
  the client renderer treats a list-content change as a layout change (f1=7 rebuild).
- `SceneRegion.style? { borderWidth, borderColor, borderRadius, padding }` → wire f5–f8,
  emitted only when non-zero (lean schema stays byte-identical for unstyled regions).
- Server→client `audio_request { action: 'start'|'stop' }`.
- List wire container = `G2_BLE_PROTOCOL.md` §6.1 (wrapper f2; f11 itemContainer
  {count,width,selBorder,names}; f12 isEventCapture). Wrapper order: f1 count, f2 lists,
  f3 texts, f4 images, f5 token.

## 6. Costs / diff strategy (why the design looks like this)

- **THE MULTI-PACKET WALL (hardware 2026-06-10):** the firmware SILENTLY ignores a single
  e0-20 message past ~4-5 AA packets (~1000 B) — no ack, no error, link stays alive (Mail's
  7-packet rebuild proved it; the 83-entry directory list hung the same way in g2code).
  Defenses: browse pages are 14 rows × ≤40 UTF-8-byte labels (~880 B frames); the client
  hard-rejects layout/launch frames > 1000 B (loud); layout frames are ACK-GATED so a
  silently-ignored frame parks visibly and `preempt()`/Reload releases + rolls it back.

- Text update ≈ 62 ms ack; list/layout rebuild ≈ 86 ms; image tile ≈ 1 s (ack-gated).
- **Menu items changing forces an f1=7 rebuild** (wire constraint). G2Renderer currently
  re-pushes ALL image content on layout change → a menu swap on a tile window costs ~4 s.
  **HW PROBE (v0.9 checklist): does pushed image content survive a rebuild that re-declares
  identical containers?** If yes → skip image re-push on layout-only changes → dynamic menus
  & window switches get cheap. Until probed, conservative re-push stays.
- Paging (Next/Prev) changes only title text + tiles — no rebuild.
- Browse windows have no images — rebuilds are ~free there.

## 7. v1.0 hardware checklist (Adam, next test window)

1. Cold-launch + the DE chrome paints (title/clock/menu/status/tabs, bordered, 33px bars —
   watch for the firmware overflow scrollbar on the shorter bars).
2. Native LIST on our hijacked slot: paints, scroll moves selection, tap → `hub_select`
   round-trip (first direct-BLE list ever — wire-spec'd from g2cap but unverified). Also the
   NON-capturing menu list in browse windows (selectBorder=0, f12=0 — also never probed).
3. Clock 12h at x469/w107: "12:59 PM" fits; tabs don't clip with the 30px right-trim
   (tunables: `CLOCK_WIDTH`, `DE_TAB_RIGHT_TRIM`). Minute tick visible.
4. Rebuild-retention probe: menu item swap on a tile screen — do the tiles stay painted?
5. 240×111 tile page push: timing + jank vs the v0.8 fullscreen finding.
6. Dictate: menu → mic → STT → prompt → response tiles (the full loop). Also: leave the
   window mid-listening → mic stops (audio_request stop in diag).
7. Reload (any menu / browse row 0): display re-takeover repaints a wedged screen.
8. Tap-vs-rebuild race feel: menu changes rebuild (~86 ms + BLE); the known residual is a tap
   landing exactly inside the rebuild window resolving against the NEW menu (mitigated by
   menu ordering; full fix = scene-version echo, deferred).
